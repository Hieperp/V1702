    //Otherwise, with no check here, all propertis of model will be generated HTML INPUT => Then: the model will submit to controller
    //If the model is submited to controller, there is nothing wrong! Sure! This will be good! Sure! BUT: ... we now face with the problem of Null value of bool properties (ApplyToAllCustomers, ApplyToAllCommodities). We can have several way to handle this, but: don't waste time for it! Okey!
